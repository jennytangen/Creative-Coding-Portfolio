This is experiment one: I have chosen to make a alternative way to read the time.

I have made it so the sun gains a new ray every hour that goes past. I wanted this to be more design than code focused (since my other experiments are more code than design focused). It took a lot of ideation time and I think that planning prior helped. I also thoroughly commented (even over commenting) the code to fully explain what I have done, since this is more technical than the tutorials.

I have made it so when the user presses play, then there will be raindrops every second. I wanted this to show the user how many seconds has gone past. However, this does not look good, so I will be thinking of a new way to show the seconds.
