This is experiment one: I have chosen to make a alternative way to read the time.

I have made it so the sun gains a new ray every hour that goes past. I wanted this to be more design than code focused (since my other experiments are more code than design focused). It took a lot of ideation time and I think that planning prior helped. I also thoroughly commented (even over commenting) the code to fully explain what I have done, since this is more technical than the tutorials.

I have made it so when the user presses play, then there will be raindrops every second. I wanted this to show the user how many seconds has gone past. However, this does not look good, so I will be thinking of a new way to show the seconds.

I created a cloud which goes past every minute. This was a very complicated code to do, which is why I overcommented the code. The methods are the same with each experiment, but I apply them in different ways.

Critical reflection:

For the first experiment, I chose to make an alternative way to represent a real-time clock. I did this by making a sun which had rays added for every hour, to make it look like a clock, but in a more post-modern way. I also added a cloud which goes past every minute to allow the user to see how much time has passed.

I think that since I focused more on the ideation and the design, the code lacked functionality. This is because the code is meant to only produce a cloud every minute, however, it produces it every time the code is run. Therefore, it isn’t as accurate as I wanted, but I still think it shows how time is passing with the cloud reappearing every minute after the first one goes past. Even though I couldn’t get this working, I still got the other code successfully working, which means the user will always get an accurate hour time (and minute time after the first cloud passes).

In the future, I will make sure to equally split time between ideation, design and implementation. This will make the process a lot smoother and generate better results. I think with my current knowledge of JavaScript, it was hard to make a working clock; however, after doing research, I was able to apply the techniques I learnt to make my code.

In conclusion, I believe this has the possibility of being a good visual alternative to a clock, however, I was unable to complete my design due to not being proficient enough with my JavaScript code. Therefore, I will continue to improve this.
