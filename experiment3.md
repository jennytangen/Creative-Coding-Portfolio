Experiment 3: Two player game.

Concept: Two players will move to 'eat' randomly placed points which will increase their score. The game ends when a player reaches 10 points. At the start of making this game, I wanted to do another concept however I changed it which is why the players are called knights.

I created the two characters and added them to the page. This will make it easier to change their starting place later since it is in am accessable place.

This allows the knights to move. Knight 1 will use arrow keys while Knight 2 will use the wasd keys. They can also use them at the same time which means the game can be playable.

I created a point which will be randomly placed.

Now, my game allows users to keep score of the points they eat. Also a new point will be created everytime another is deleted.

This is my finished game. I changed the background which made it looked more finished. The game fully works. I also increased the speed since I think this would be more fun for the users.
