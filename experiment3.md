Experiment 3: Two player game.

Concept: Two players will move to 'eat' randomly placed points which will increase their score. Every second the players will be bigger and if they touch, the game ends and the person with the higher score wins. At the start of making this game, I wanted to do another concept however I changed it which is why the players are called knights.

I created the two characters and added them to the page. This will make it easier to change their starting place later since it is in am accessable place.

This allows the knights to move. Knight 1 will use arrow keys while Knight 2 will use the wasd keys. They can also use them at the same time which means the game can be playable.

I created a point which will be randomly placed.
