This is my first attempt on creating 4 different brush tools. Currently, the code doesn't work. I am trying to create buttons for each brush to make it easier for the user to draw.

This successfully creates a button which when pressed, will change the mouse to a solid black brush. Then when the user drags their mouse across the screen, it will create a line.

I have added my new code. This includes a spray brush now. I have also reduced the size of the brush tool since I thought it was too big last time. I have added important comments to my code to explain what I have done.

I added a new brush where the user can now draw with squares. This was quite a simple addition with small, but crucial changes. I commented the code about the other new changes.

I successfully added an eraser to the code. To make it, I made the colour of the brush the same as the background colour so it would blend in.

Critical reflection:


I chose to make the 4 different ‘brush’ types for the second experiment. Overall, I think it went well as I completed the brief. However, I could have added more artistic choices and designed it for a better user experience.

The parts that went well were how I could easily understand how the variables changed the outcome of the code. This made it easier to create new brushes and allowed me to think in a more creative way since I could change the code as I wanted instead of relying on a tutorial. I added to tutorials and made my own brushes, which they didn't show me. I think this, paired with also creating working buttons, made my code creative but efficient. It was harder to add buttons, but I think it was worth the time.

I could have improved the brush designs. This was mostly due to not ideating enough at the start of making the project. Therefore, if I were to redo this experiment, I would make more brushes and make them different shapes and colours. However, since I was unable to do this, I think this experiment is lacking. Since I focused more on the code aspect, I left out the other part of the brief, which is to make it more creative. I thought that the buttons and new brushes were enough; however, upon reflection, I believe I could have done more. In conclusion, I will add more features next time and plan more carefully to make it easier to do more intricate designs.
