This is my first attempt on creating 4 different brush tools. Currently, the code doesn't work. I am trying to create buttons for each brush to make it easier for the user to draw.

This successfully creates a button which when pressed, will change the mouse to a solid black brush. Then when the user drags their mouse across the screen, it will create a line.
