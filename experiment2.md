This is my first attempt on creating 4 different brush tools. Currently, the code doesn't work. I am trying to create buttons for each brush to make it easier for the user to draw.

This successfully creates a button which when pressed, will change the mouse to a solid black brush. Then when the user drags their mouse across the screen, it will create a line.

I have added my new code. This includes a spray brush now. I have also reduced the size of the brush tool since I thought it was too big last time. I have added important comments to my code to explain what I have done.

I added a new brush where the user can now draw with squares. This was quite a simple addition with small, but crucial changes. I commented the code about the other new changes.
